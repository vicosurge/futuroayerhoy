Perfect — I can do that. Below I prepared the Jekyll front matter using your example and a suggested slug shortened to the keywords you requested. Replace the TBC content with the story text you send and I’ll convert it to Markdown, preserving the original style and punctuation (only fixing grammar when absolutely necessary).

TBC

Before you send the parts, a few quick formatting preferences so I convert exactly how you want:
- Send each piece as a separate message with a header such as: PART 1 — Ensayo / POESÍA / RELATO / RESEÑA.
- For poetry, preserve line breaks and stanza breaks exactly as you provide them.
- For dialogue or stories, keep original punctuation and line breaks; I’ll only normalize obvious typos or grammar issues if they impede comprehension.
- If there are images, captions, footnotes, or references, indicate where they should go and provide filenames/URLs.
- If you want a custom excerpt, featured image, or different tags/categories per piece, include that info with the text.
- If any content requires special inline formatting (italics, bold, blockquote), mark it or tell me how you want it rendered.

Send the first part when ready and I’ll convert it to Markdown with the front matter applied.
